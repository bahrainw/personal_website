This is my first foray into webdev.


I started off with this base template: 

Solid State by HTML5 UP

	Other:
		jQuery (jquery.com)
		Scrollex (github.com/ajlkn/jquery.scrollex)
		Responsive Tools (github.com/ajlkn/responsive-tools)
		
I also used code from this for the particle effect.

Eventually I will clean up the .css files and streamline it to only have the styling that I ended up using.
